I built a fully functional Hangman game in C that validates secret phrases, filters characters, and manages the game state from start to finish. 
The program generates the hidden phrase, tracks eliminated letters in alphabetical order, and updates the game display after each guess. 
It also renders progressive ASCII gallows art and handles all user interaction through the command line. 
The project demonstrates solid control over C string manipulation, input handling, and structured program design.
